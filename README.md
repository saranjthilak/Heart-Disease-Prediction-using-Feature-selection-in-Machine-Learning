Application of Genetic algorithm in normal  machine learning algorithms for better accuracy, 


Methodology

        Several studies on heart disease have been carried out by using machine learning techniques; but the performance of these models are not optimal.

        Therefore, we introduce a new model. Firstly, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Decision tree were applied to the dataset for the prediction of heart disease.

        The performance of these models is evaluated by using 3-fold cross validation and highest average accuracy of 87.78% is obtained by the Naive Bayes.

        Further, we have applied a genetic algorithm to the dataset to optimize the features.

        After optimization, the highest average accuracy of 96% is achieved by the Naive Bayes.
